#classify we use git.

Work Space

There are two work spaces 
local work space
remote work space

developers works at local work space 
will make necessary modifications and  will get access to remote ws by cloning.

all modified or new files will be stored in a respository in remote ws

indetail:  > create a respository(git-cmds) at github and get ssh url from code 

inlocal machine : get ssh key -< ssh-keygen>

#key will be generated. move  to ssh dir 
 cd .ssh
# view content of ssh dir
  ls -altr

# you will get know where pub key is stored 
   cat  * absolutepath
# key will be displayed, copy the key and paste it at remote work space

# get installed git 
  sudo yum install git -y
 
# as we know the ssh url &  clone the respository by using 
  git clone *ssh url

# frist time only we use " git clone" after that at any time we use 
  git pull

# by cloning , a new  respository (dir) will be created at local machine

# move to that dir and make necessary modifications by creating new files if needed
 cd dirctory name
# we can check the status of git flow by
 git status

# all the files will be added
`git add .`

# all added files will be commited to that particular respository
git commit -m "messages" 

# all files which we have modified and created will be reflected at remote ws.
git push 

# initilazion of directory by using 
 git init

# branching strategy 
  The GitHub flow branching strategy is a relatively simple workflow that allows smaller teams, or web applications/products that don't require supporting multiple versions, to expedite their work.

# check all branches 
    git branch -a

# changw a branch
    git checkout 'name of the branch'

# create A new branch
   git branch "name" 

# remove the branch 
 git rm branch " name"


this is how git cmd and  github will be used in realtime
